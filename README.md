# agi-core: The Universal Learning Loop

**One algorithm. Pluggable domains. Compounding intelligence.**

```
WAKE:   observe → hypothesize → execute → score → store
SLEEP:  analyze solutions → extract recurring sub-programs → compress → add to library
REPEAT: library grows → search shrinks → harder problems → compounding
```

Based on the research and principles proposed by [Vibhor Jain](https://github.com/vibhor-77).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/vibhor-77/agi-core.git
cd agi-core

# Optional: create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Clone the ARC-AGI datasets
git clone https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI.git data/ARC-AGI
git clone https://github.com/arcprizeorg/ARC-AGI-2.git data/ARC-AGI-2

# Reproduce our results — one command does train + eval with culture transfer
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --rounds 3

# Run the test suite (~4 seconds)
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

The default mode is pipeline: interleaved train → eval rounds, saving the learned culture after each training round and evaluating with it. Results, logs, visualizations, and culture snapshots are auto-saved with timestamps.

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, NumPy, SciPy, Numba. See `requirements.txt`.

### Syncing an existing clone

```bash
git pull origin main
pip install -r requirements.txt
git -C data/ARC-AGI pull
git -C data/ARC-AGI-2 pull
```

## Usage

All domains run through a single CLI entry point:

```bash
# Full pipeline: train → eval × N rounds (default)
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --rounds 3

# Quick subset for development (50 tasks, 1M compute cap, ~18s)
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --mode quick

# Train only, save culture for later
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --run-mode single --split training
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --run-mode single --split training --save-culture my_culture.json

# Eval only with a pre-trained culture file
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --run-mode single --split evaluation --culture runs/TIMESTAMP_culture.json

# Single-process for debugging
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --workers 1

# Batch mode for hyperparameter sweeps (no visualization, minimal console output)
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --mode quick --batch
```

### Running a subset of tasks

Tasks are **shuffled by default** using a deterministic seed (`--seed 42`), so any subset is a representative random sample:

```bash
# Quick mode already uses 50 tasks — fastest way to iterate
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --mode quick

# Custom subset: 100 tasks with default search depth
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --max-tasks 100

# Tiny smoke test: 10 tasks
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --mode quick --max-tasks 10

# Multi-round compounding on quick subset
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --mode quick --rounds 3
```

### Other domains

```bash
# ARC-AGI-2 (1000 training + 120 eval tasks, harder than AGI-1)
python -m common --domain arc-agi-2 --mode quick

# Zork text adventure — navigate rooms, collect items, unlock doors
python -m common --domain zork --mode quick

# List operations — compounding demonstration
python -m common --domain list-ops --mode quick

# Symbolic regression — discover mathematical formulas (y=2x+1, y=x², y=sin(x)+x, ...)
python -m domains.symbolic_math
```

### Auto-saved artifacts

Every run automatically saves timestamped files:

```
runs/arc_agi_1_training_TIMESTAMP.jsonl        — live per-task results (tail -f friendly)
runs/arc_agi_1_training_TIMESTAMP.json         — final results: meta + summary + per-task + library
runs/arc_agi_1_training_TIMESTAMP_culture.json — learned culture snapshot (for eval / cross-run transfer)
runs/arc_agi_1_training_TIMESTAMP_viz.html     — results visualization (index)
runs/arc_agi_1_training_TIMESTAMP.log          — full console output
```

Pipeline mode adds:
```
runs/arc_agi_1_pipeline_TIMESTAMP_culture.jsonl — live learning events across all rounds
runs/arc_agi_1_pipeline_TIMESTAMP.json         — combined train + eval results + compounding curve
```

Monitor a running benchmark:
```bash
tail -f runs/arc_agi_1_*.jsonl    # watch task results as they complete
tail -f runs/*_culture.jsonl      # watch library growth across rounds
```

### Visualization

HTML visualizations are auto-generated after every run. The index page shows all tasks with colored status indicators and grid previews. Click any task to see step-by-step primitive execution showing each intermediate transformation. Learned abstractions are expanded inline.

```bash
# Regenerate visualization from a previous run
python -m experiments.visualize_results runs/arc_agi_1_training_TIMESTAMP.json

# Filter to only show overfit tasks
python -m experiments.visualize_results runs/arc_agi_1_training_TIMESTAMP.json --filter overfit
```

### Verifying individual solves

The console output ends with a **SOLVED TASKS** section listing every solved task and its program:

```
  SOLVED TASKS (4 total)
    ✓ 08ed6ac7                 program: label_components
    ✓ 1cf80156                 program: crop_to_content
    ✓ 1e0a9b12                 program: gravity_down
    ✓ 2013d3e2                 program: crop_half_left(learned_8=crop_half_top(crop_to_content))
```

"Solved" means the program passes held-out test examples — the real metric. Learned abstractions show their expansion inline.

## Presets

Three modes. Pick one. That's the only knob most users need.

| Mode | Tasks | Compute Cap | Use case |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `quick` | 50 | 1M | Fast dev loop (~18s) |
| `default` | all (400) | 3M | Full benchmark (~2 min) |
| `contest` | all (400) | 50M | Maximum accuracy (~12 min) |

Presets differ only in compute budget. All search parameters — rounds, pair/triple pool sizes, beam width — are **auto-derived** from the compute cap via `derive_search_params()`. Higher budget → wider search pools → more solves on a single diminishing-returns curve. CLI flags like `--exhaustive-pair-top-k` override auto-derived values when explicitly set.

All runs use **atomic vocabulary** — 75 primitives (54 atomic transforms + 12 perception + 9 parameterized). Each primitive is one intuitive visual concept. 12 predicates enable conditional branching. Structural search strategies (per-object, cross-reference, procedural, local rules) compose these same primitives in structurally different ways.

Rounds are auto-derived: 2 for budget ≥200K, 3 for ≥20M. Results are fully deterministic with **seed 42** (`PYTHONHASHSEED=0` is enforced automatically).

**Performance by mode** (measured 2026-03-18):

| Mode | Tasks | Cap | Training | Eval | Wall time |
|------|-------|-----|----------|------|-----------|
| quick | 50 | 1M | 19/50 (38%) | 7/50 (14%) | 22s |
| default | 400 | 3M | **121/400 (30.2%)** | **53/400 (13.2%)** | ~6 min |

Default mode uses 3 rounds with culture transfer.

**Compute cap** is cell-normalized (larger grids get proportionally fewer evals). Override with `--compute-cap`:

```bash
python -m common --domain arc-agi-1 --compute-cap 100M    # override preset cap
```

### Expected performance

**ARC-AGI-1** (measured 2026-03-19):

| Mode | Training (400) | Eval (400) | Library | Overfit | Wall time |
|------|---------------|------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| default | **121/400 (30.2%)** | **53/400 (13.2%)** | ~39 | ~9 / ~3 | ~6 min |

Solve criterion uses max-example-error (all examples must be solved, not just average) — this is stricter than avg-based, so numbers reflect genuine all-example solves.

Quick mode (50 tasks, ~22s): 19/50 (38%) train, 7/50 (14%) eval.

**Other domains:**

| Domain | Eval Tasks | Solved | Rate | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| ARC-AGI-2 | 120 | 0 | 0.0% | With culture transfer from 1000 training tasks |
| Zork | 20 | 10 | 50% | 5 library entries, reuse 2-6x (5 rounds) |
| List Ops | 28 | 20 | 71.4% | 8 library entries, reuse 2-6x (3 rounds) |

**Three primitive kinds:** transforms (Grid→Grid), perception (Grid→Value), and parameterized ((Value,...) → Grid→Grid factory). Parameterized prims like `swap_colors(background_color, dominant_color)` are fully transferable — same program works on any task regardless of specific colors.

**Depth-3 exhaustive enumeration** with no-op pruning and binary near-miss refinement.

**10 wake phases:** exhaustive enumeration, object decomposition, for-each-object, cross-reference (boolean halves, half-colormap, separator ops, scale/tile, quadrant), local rules (cellular automata + position-modular + ncolors), procedural object DSL (per-object action rules, movement, extraction), conditional search, color fix + cell-wise patch, input-pred correction.

**Sleep learning** extracts subtrees from ALL programs (solved + unsolved), quality-weighted by accuracy. Promotes transferable compositions to a bounded library with eviction — reused entries are immune, weak entries displaced by better ones.

**Interleaved pipeline** runs train → eval per round, so each eval shows the value of compounding so far. The compounding curve (train/eval per round) is printed at the end and saved in the pipeline JSON.

## Options

|------|---------|-------------|
| `--domain` | (required) | Domain: `arc-agi-1`, `arc-agi-2`, `zork`, or `list-ops` |
| `--mode` | `default` | Preset: `quick`, `default`, or `contest` |
| `--run-mode` | `pipeline` | `pipeline` (train → eval per round) or `single` (train or eval only) |
| `--split` | `training` | Data split for single mode: `training` or `evaluation` |
| `--rounds` | auto | Wake-sleep rounds (auto-derived: 2 for ≥200K, 3 for ≥20M budget) |
| `--sequential-compounding` | off | Process tasks sequentially with immediate concept promotion |

| `--exhaustive-depth` | `3` | Exhaustive enumeration depth (`0`=off, `2`=pairs, `3`=triples) |
| `--exhaustive-pair-top-k` | auto | Top-K singles for pair enumeration pool (auto-derived from compute cap) |
| `--exhaustive-triple-top-k` | auto | Top-K singles for triple enumeration pool (auto-derived from compute cap) |
| `--task-ids` | none | Comma-separated task IDs to run (prefix match) |

| `--batch` | off | Batch mode: skip visualization + per-task output (for hyperparameter sweeps) |

## How It Works

### The wake-sleep loop

1. **WAKE**: For each task, search for a program that transforms input to output.
   - **Exhaustive enumeration** (depth 1-3): tries all single primitives, top-K pairs, and top-K triples. Parameterized prims are tried with all perception children.
   - **Near-miss refinement**: takes programs with error < 20% and tries appending, prepending, or wrapping with binary ops (overlay, mask_by).
   - No-op pruning: primitives that don't change the grid are skipped at depth 2+.
2. **SLEEP**: Analyze all solved programs and best unsolved attempts.
   Extract recurring sub-programs, quality-weighted by accuracy (solved=1.0, unsolved=max(exp(-error)×0.5, solve_score×0.5)).
   Per-example solve scoring: `(k/n)^2` where k=examples solved perfectly — a 2/3-solver always beats a uniformly mediocre program.
   **Primitive ROI tracking**: credit all primitives in program trees with quality weight; scores accumulate across tasks and decay each round. Library entries get ROI seeded from usefulness at promotion, closing the feedback loop: proven entries get search priority.
   Promote transferable compositions (depth 2+) directly as library entries.
   Train composition priors (transition matrix) on all programs.
   Bounded library with eviction: reused entries are immune, weak entries displaced by better ones.
3. **REPEAT**: The grown library expands the effective vocabulary.
   Depth-1 search over a promoted depth-2 composition reaches depth-3 effectively.
   This is the compounding mechanism — each round builds on the last.

### The 4 interfaces

Every domain implements exactly 4 things:

| Interface | What it does | Symbolic Math | ARC-AGI | Zork |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------|------|
| **Environment** | Execute programs | Evaluate formula on x | Apply grid transform | Execute game action |
| **Grammar** | Define primitives, compose/mutate | sin, cos, +, × | rotate, flip, crop | move, take, use |
| **DriveSignal** | Score: error + complexity | MSE + node count | -log(similarity) + size | Game score + novelty |
| **Memory** | Store episodes, library, solutions | InMemoryStore | InMemoryStore | InMemoryStore |

The core loop (`core/learner.py`) depends **only** on these interfaces. It never imports anything domain-specific.

### Terminology

- **solved** — program passes held-out test examples (the real metric)
- **train_solved** — program matches training examples within a task (may overfit)
- **overfit** — train_solved but NOT solved (matched training, failed test)
- **solve_rate** — fraction of tasks solved (test-verified)

### The key metric: the compounding curve

```
COMPOUNDING CURVE (train / eval per round):
Round         Train  Overfit  Library          Eval  Overfit
─────  ────────────  ───────  ───────  ────────────  ───────
    1  100/400 (25.0%)       6       30    39/400 (9.8%)        2
    2  106/400 (26.5%)       7       30    45/400 (11.2%)       2
```

If solve rate increases across rounds without new hand-coded primitives, the framework is working.

### Current status

**ARC-AGI-1: 109/400 training (27.3%), 46/400 eval (11.5%)** with 75 atomic primitives and 10 wake phases + 12 local rule types. Per-object recolor (10 strategies) contributes ~15% of training solves. Procedural object DSL adds object-level reasoning (fill, movement, extraction). Library entries transfer to eval. Solve criterion uses max-example-error (stricter than avg) so all numbers are genuine all-example solves.

**Ten wake phases** compose the same atomic primitives differently:
1. **Exhaustive enumeration** — depth 1-3 sequential pipelines + mixed parameterized/transform compositions
2. **Object decomposition** — per-object transforms, conditional recolor by 10 property strategies
3. **For-each-object** — apply top-K candidates per connected component
4. **Cross-reference** — boolean halves, half-colormap (learn pixel-tuple→output mapping from grid halves), separator ops, scale/tile detection, quadrant colormap
5. **Local rules** — cellular automaton rules (compact, count, raw 3×3, position-modular, ncolors) with LOOCV
6. **Procedural object DSL** — per-object action rules (fill bbox, extend rays, movement, extraction) learned from pixel diffs
7. **Conditional search** — if(predicate, A, B) programs using 12 input predicates
8. **Color fix** — learn color remapping from near-miss program outputs
9. **Cell-wise patch** — learn fixed pixel corrections for near-miss outputs (<15% difference)
10. **Input-pred correction** — learn (input_pixel, prediction_pixel) → output_pixel rules with LOOCV

**Three primitive kinds:** transforms (Grid→Grid), perception (Grid→Value), and parameterized ((Value,...) → Grid→Grid factory). All compositions are fully transferable across tasks. **12 predicates** enable conditional branching (if/else programs).

### Current limitations

- **Composition depth bottleneck.** Depth-4+ compositions are verified to work manually but can't be found by depth-3 exhaustive search. Compounding across rounds builds up to depth-4+ but saturates quickly.
- **Overfit gap.** Training 30.2% vs eval 13.2% — some structural strategies (per-object recolor, local rules) learn task-specific rules that don't transfer.
- **Search space dilution.** Adding primitives that don't solve new tasks is harmful (confirmed: 3 unnecessary prims caused -3 regression). Each new primitive must be pre-tested on unsolved tasks.
- **Remaining tasks need complex reasoning.** ~295 unsolved training tasks need object-relationship logic, relative positioning, pattern completion, or multi-step conditional operations beyond current template matching.
