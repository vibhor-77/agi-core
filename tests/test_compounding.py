"""
Tests for the compounding hypothesis: library learning improves solve rate.

These tests verify the core claim of the framework — that the wake-sleep loop
produces genuine compounding, not just search. They are the most important
tests in the suite.

Three categories:
1. Library reuse: learned entries are actually used in subsequent tasks
2. Multi-round improvement: solve rate increases across rounds
3. Cross-domain: same algorithm works on structurally different domains
